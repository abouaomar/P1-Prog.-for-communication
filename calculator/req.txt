Project: Build a Network Calculator from Scratch
Create a client-server calculator system that performs mathematical operations over the network.
Step 1: Protocol Design
Design a simple text-based protocol called CalcProtocol/1.0:
Request Format:
OPERATION operand1 operand2
Response Format:
STATUS result
Operations: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, POW, SQRT
Status Codes: OK, ERROR, INVALID
Examples:
Client: ADD 5 3
Server: OK 8

Client: DIV 10 0
Server: ERROR Division by zero

Client: SQRT 16
Server: OK 4
Step 2: Server Implementation
Version 1: Single-threaded calculator server

Accept one client at a time
Parse mathematical expressions
Return results or error messages

Version 2: Multi-threaded calculator server

Handle multiple clients simultaneously
Thread-safe operation logging
Connection management

Step 3: Client Implementation
Create clients in:

Python: Interactive calculator client
JavaScript: Simple calculator interface
Java: Command-line calculator client

Step 4: Error Handling
Handle:

Protocol errors: Invalid operations, malformed requests
Math errors: Division by zero, invalid operands
Network errors: Connection timeouts, server unavailable
Input validation: Non-numeric inputs, missing operands

Learning Goals:

Understand basic client-server communication
Practice socket programming fundamentals
Learn protocol design principles
Implement error handling strategies
Experience multi-threaded programming

Deliverables:

Protocol specification document
Working server (both versions)
Three different language clients
Error handling demonstrations
Testing script with various scenarios

This simplified project teaches the same networking concepts as the web server but focuses on mathematical operations instead of HTTP complexity.
